Sweptstation is a fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/). There's no real plans for significant overhauls of gameplay systems or the like, it's mostly alternate sprites and content/balance tweaking.

## Contributing

Contributions are fine, but if it's ANYTHING that can help Space Station 14 as a whole, (Bug fixes, major gameplay systems, patches) please direct them to the [upstream repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/). Get in the discord if you want to help/yell at Swept. If you're looking for sprites, I usually dump stuff in SS14's rsi-dump.
